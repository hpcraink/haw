JavaEE Server backend for HAW project
-------------------------------------

The project "Hochschulen fuer Angewandte Wissenschaften" allows
getting to setup and read out the compute shares on HPC compute
resources at various HPC providers.
It's developped in the frame bwHPC and bwHPC-C5 for the
state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany.

The server component relies heavily on code developped
by students of the Hochschule fuer Technik, Stuttgart,
the so-called JAK-Project:
